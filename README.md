# ABLeS
_Australian BioCommons Leadership Share_

The intention of ABLeS is to apply computing power and related resources to construct, 
maintain and gain insights from community defined and developed data assets 
(e.g. reference genome assemblies).

It will also be used to evaluate the efficacy of digital tools and methods in relation to the species under 
investigation and/or the project aim, including the computational and data requirements 
that underpin publication outcomes.

As of December 2020, the AusARG community has been granted access to ABLeS,
and  the following resources are available via NCI:

1. The Gadi supercomputing platform, 
2. The Tenjin cloud computing platform,
3. Live data storage service (home and scratch storage), and
4. Archival data storage services.

The AusARG allocation is co-managed by lead bioinformaticians Hardip Patel and Terry Bertozzi, 
who are responsible for approval and oversight of the allocation and the users within it.

**Learning together**

The ABLeS journey is collaborative and involves the the BioCommons, the research community, and the facilities. 
Communities such as ABLeS will work to understand their tools, methods and optimal approaches to solve the bioinformatics problems at hand. 

It is expected that communities will engage the BioCommons in an open and collaborative manner, with regular meetups (expected frequency ~ 2 monthly).

A concrete outcome of that engagement will be reports and notes on toolsets, workflows, methods, resource usage and quality assessments for derived reference data sets, to support and assist other communities. 



**Using the AusARG share**

The AusARG Steering Committee will direct the use of ABLeS, 
ensuring that resource consumption is aligned with the prioritise of the community. 

**AusARG priorities for 2021**

The AusARG SC has prioritised the following species and work to be undertaken through ABLeS in 2021:
1. .. 
2. .. 
3. ..
